    "question": "How much should I save before I start investing?",
    "answer": "Build an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses before investing aggressively. This protects you from being forced to sell investments at a loss during emergencies. Once your emergency fund is secure, you can confidently invest surplus income. Many experts recommend having at least $1,000 in emergency savings immediately, then working toward the full 3-6 month cushion while beginning modest investments."

    "question": "How long does it take to complete a course?",
    "answer": "Most courses contain 3-5 modules with 3-5 lessons each, totaling 15-25 lessons per course. With lessons ranging from 5-15 minutes, you can complete a full course in 3-6 hours of total study time. However, we recommend spreading learning over 2-4 weeks to allow time for practice and implementation. You can learn at your own pace and revisit lessons anytime."

If you're completely new to a subject, simply start with the first module and progress sequentially through the lessons."

    "question": "Are the quizzes mandatory?",
    "answer": "Quizzes are optional but highly recommended. They reinforce learning through active recall, which significantly improves retention. Each quiz question includes an explanation after you answer, providing additional context. Your quiz scores are tracked privately and help you identify areas where you might want to review. Many learners find that attempting quizzes before and after studying a lesson deepens understanding."
