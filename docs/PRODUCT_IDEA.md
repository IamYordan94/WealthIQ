# WealthIQ – Product Idea

## App purpose and audience

**WealthIQ** is an educational mobile app (Android/Expo) whose primary job is to **teach**. The app helps users learn across 12 sectors: health, personal finance, investing, career, real estate, AI, digital marketing, productivity, entrepreneurship, mental resilience, coding, and content creation. Everything in the app—tools, info, and subscription—supports learning.

**Audience**: Adults who want to improve their knowledge and habits in these areas, with a clear free tier and optional subscription for full access.

---

## Free tier

- **First course (Health & Wellness)** is **fully free**.
- For all **other courses**: **3 lessons per module** are free; the rest of the lessons in that module are paid.
- **Advanced modules** and **premium tools** are paid.
- This structure is designed as an optimal funnel: users can experience the full first course and sample each other course before subscribing.

## What “tools” and “info” mean

### Tools

- **Calculators**: e.g. compound interest, savings goal, budget split.
- **Planners**: e.g. goal setting, action plans, habit trackers.
- Other utility tools that support learning (to be expanded; list in app can grow without changing curriculum).

### Info

- **Tips**: Short, actionable tips by category (finance, health, productivity, etc.).
- **Glossary**: Definitions of key terms used across courses.
- **FAQs**: Common questions and short answers.
- **Sector overviews**: Brief summaries of each course/sector.

Content for tips, glossary, FAQs, and overviews will be populated later (e.g. via Perplexity) using the same structure.

---

## Curriculum content

- Curriculum follows the schema: **Course → Module → Lesson**.
- Each lesson has **content** (sections: text, lists, etc.) and an optional **quiz**.
- Full curriculum content (all 12 courses, all modules and lessons) will be **populated later** (e.g. generated and pasted, or piped from Perplexity). The app uses a fixed schema and minimal placeholder content so it stays runnable and ready for bulk content.

## Single source of truth

This document is the single source of truth for “what the app is” before and during implementation. Code and feature modules align with this idea.
